## Problem Statement
Person A has just been accepted into the 2024 Masters in Data Analytics program at RMIT, Melbourne, Australia. They are preparing Visa documents and the Immigration Office requires them to find housing before they move to Australia. They would like to find a place that suits the below needs:
1. At least within 10kms of RMIT (Melb CBD)
2. Average Weekly Rent is below $300 AUD
3. Single bedroom unit is highly preferred 

*Currently there is no ‘one stop shop’ view of Melbourne’s suburbs to provide new international students this view of our great city. Students must search across multiple websites (e.g. RealEstate.com, Visit Melbourne, Youtube etc). The Melbourne Rental Market Dashboard aims to solve this gap in the market.*


## Dashboard Components
The Melbourne Rental Market Dashboard includes the following:
- Home Page
- Project Overview page
- Market Map page
- Pie chart page
- Bar chart page
- Scatter plot page

Note:
- The side navigation bar provides quick access to the raw JSON & GeoJSON
- These call on Leaflet (mapping), Plotly (graphs/charts), Chart (graphs/charts), D3 and Video (introductory video) JS libraries.
# SCREENSHOTS REQUIRED


## Development Workflow
*TBD - WILL PULL FROM GOOGLE SLIDES ONCE COMPLETED*
